Automatic Farmer Restart (**LINUX ONLY**)
This is the same tool as the Automatic Farmer Restart but only for Linux Operating Systems. 👈👈

⚠️ This LINUX script assumes you are using ```pipenv run python ./main.py``` for running the farmer.
If you are using something else, please modify the command in the script as required. 

To run this script, download it and move it to the same directory as your Farmer installation, ensure you terminate any other processes related to the Farmer and start the file with ```./restarter.sh```. Please note you might need to give 'run' permissions to the file by typing the command ```sudo chmod 777 ./restarter.sh``` (might vary depending on OS)
